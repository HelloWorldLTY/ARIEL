# Codes for paper: Performing Scientific Research with Artificial Intelligence ResearcherðŸ¤”: A Comprehensive Study with Expert-Involved Evaluation

## Installation

To install the environment for querying LLM/LMM from API or Huggingface with local inference, please refer the yml file: **air.yml**. In short, installing [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) is enoughðŸ˜„.

To install the environment for evaluating the summary accuracy, please refer the yml file: **eval.yml**.

To finetune an LLM, please refer the codes in [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory).


## Datasets

Please visit our [Huggingface page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/iLOVE2D/AIR_DATA) for the access of datasets.

## Running

For the experiments of long document summarization, please refer the folder **text_eval**.

For the experiments of scientific figure understanding, please refer the folder **image_eval**.

For the experiments of self-verification and self-correction, please refer the folder **self_improve**.
